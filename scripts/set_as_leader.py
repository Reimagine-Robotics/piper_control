"""Sets the robot arm as leader in the leader/follower or master/slave setup.

Leader/follower setups have 2 separate arms wired to the same CAN bus, and you
can set one as the leader (a.k.a. master) and the other as the follower (a.k.a.
slave).

While we tested these setups, we noticed that afterwards the follower arm would
not be functional anymore in a standalone setup. This script allows you to
revert the follower arm back to a working config, by setting it as a
leader/master.
